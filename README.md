Dispatch-breakout helpers
=========================

This code automates one of the painful processes required to move forward in the "boardgame"
dispatch breakout.

*Caution: There might be **spoilers** if you haven't figured out the 3rd volume*

Have fun!









### Sherlock script

To automate the sherlock code (words hidden in sherlock holmes books).

```python

import sherlock

sherlock.find_words([('asis', 1,1,7), ('tgs', 18,1,26)])

### Output
# (asis, 1, 1, 7) => my
# (tgs, 18, 1, 26) => last
```
